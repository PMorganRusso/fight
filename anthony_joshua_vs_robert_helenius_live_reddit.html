His combination of power, speed, and technical prowess has earned him a massive following and a reputation as a force to be reckoned with.

Robert Helenius, hailing from Finland, may not carry the same level of fame as Joshua, but he brings a wealth of experience and determination into this fight. Helenius has faced his share of challenges and victories, and his resilience in the ring has earned him respect among boxing enthusiasts. Known for his imposing stature and hard-hitting style, he poses a formidable threat to any opponent.

The Anthony Joshua vs. Robert Helenius bout promises to be a classic clash of contrasting styles. Joshua, with his athleticism and boxing skills, often prefers to dictate the pace of the fight and engage from the outside. He possesses a lethal jab and a powerful right hand that have been instrumental in his victories.

Helenius, on the other hand, is likely to rely on his physical attributes, such as his reach advantage and punching power, to disrupt Joshua's rhythm. If he can successfully close the distance and land his heavy shots, he could potentially expose any vulnerabilities in Joshua's defense.<p>
<p>
The expectations for this fight are high, with fans eagerly awaiting a decisive outcome that could reshape the heavyweight landscape. A victory for Joshua would solidify his position as a dominant force in the division and potentially set the stage for future high-profile matchups, including potential unification bouts.</p><p></p>
